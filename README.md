Here is about the whole process of our group project for CS143 Network-Simulator Course Project.  

Description from offcial guidelines (http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs143/Project/guidelines.pdf).  

Test cases from official websites (http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs143/Project/test_cases.pdf).  

Environment:

How to run our codes:  

  If you use an IDE:  
  
    Just run main.py. Done! :)  
    
  If you use command line:   
  (under the directory of CS143_Network-Simulator, -t to choose the testX.txt, -f to choose the flowsX.txt)  
  e.g.  
  
    python3 ./main.py -t test2.txt -f flows2.txt  
    
If you want to choose TCP algorithms, please modify the rightmost column of flowsX.txt.   
e.g.   

    F1	H1	H2	20971520	1.0	FAST
